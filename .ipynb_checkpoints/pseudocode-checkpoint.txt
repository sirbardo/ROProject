13. for each route in Routes:
    1. while this route can be feasibly (respecting the constraints) merged further:
	   1.determine the first saving s_ki or s_jl in the ordered list that can feasibly be used to merge the current route with another route containing either the arc (k, 0) or (0, l). 
       	   2. merge the two routes.
